    <p class="p" >Great Wall of China
        The Great Wall of China was built during the Qin dynasty to protect the borders of the ancient Chinese states in imperial China against invasion by foreigners. It also had an economic benefit, as it provided border controls and allowed the imposition of duties on goods transported along the Silk Road. This longest wall in the world is a collection of several walls built during the 7th century BC which were later joined together. The most famous among these walls is the one built by Qin Shi Huang during 220–206 BC. The fortifications are made up of stone, brick, wood, and many other materials.
        Petra
        The city of Petra is an archaeological site in Jordan that lies on the slope of Mount Jebel al-Madhbah. In 1984, UNESCO described it as “half built and half carved into the rock at the interior of a circle of mountains…is obviously one of the most precious cultural properties [of] man’s cultural heritage”. Petra, also known as the “Rose City”, was built by the Nabataeans who inhabited in the city for more than a thousand years. They used the city’s location to lay the foundation of a trading hub. The place is not only famous for its rock architecture of vibrant vermilion, moon white and pink colors, but also for its innovative water conduit system. Fun fact – Petra was used as the setting where Indiana Jones finds the Holy Grail in the 1989 blockbuster Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.
        Colosseum
        This partially ruined amphitheater in Rome,  the Colosseum, is the largest amphitheatre ever built. Its original Latin name was Amphitheatrum Flavium. In AD 72, the Roman emperor Vespasian laid the foundation of this monument. This structure had the capacity to hold approximately 50,000–80,000 spectators. The place was mostly used for gladiator contests, executions, animal hunts and re-enactments of famous battles and dramas. Despite being ruined by natural and man-made catastrophes, it still pulls a large number of tourists.
        Chichen Itza
        The Chichen Itza is the most visited heritage site in Mexico. It was once a large pre-Columbian city made by the Mayan people. This site reveals the mixture of the architectural styles of Mexico, Puuc and Chenes. This pyramid, also known as the Temple of the Warriors, structure comprises of a number of square terraces and staircases on each of the four sides of the temple. It is a fine sight during the spring and autumn equinoxes. The sun creates a series of triangular shadows, creating an illusion of a serpent crawling down the stairs.
        Taj Mahal
        The Mughal emperor Shah Jahan constructed this jewel of Muslim art to accommodate the tomb of Mumtaz Mahal, his dearest wife. Ustad Isa, the master architect of this heritage site had efficiently captured the varied moods of Mumtaz in this ivory-white marble mausoleum. The Taj Mahal reveals varied shades of color throughout the day, including a soft golden color in the morning and during sunset. It took approximately 20 years and 20,000 labourers and artists to create this renowned beauty.
        Machu Picchu
        Located in the Cusco Region, Machupicchu district in Peru, these ancient Incan ruins have been a favorite destination among tourists. These ruins include palaces, temples and homes which may have been constructed for a ceremonial or military purpose, or as a retreat for the royals. They are surrounded by the stormy and chaotic Urubamba River flowing in the Sacred Valley. Due to the lack of records of written language, we don’t have any information about why the Incas built this heritage site or abandoned it. In 1911, American historian Hiram Bingham introduced this isolated place and brought it to international attention. Presently, most of the buildings in Machu Picchu have been reconstructed.
        Christ the Redeemer
        Christ the Redeemer is an art deco statue of Jesus Christ in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. This structure was created by the combined efforts of French sculptor Paul Landowski, Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa, Romanian sculptor Gheorghe Leonida and French engineer Albert Caquot. Situated at the apex of Mount Corcovado in Rio de Janeiro, this awe-inspiring statue weighs 635 metric tons and is 30-meter tall. It’s made of concrete and a mosaic of many triangular soapstones.
